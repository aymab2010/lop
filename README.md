## How To Setup

In your env file there is one things you need to fill in!

```
BOT_TOKEN=
```

First head to the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers) and create an application, then create a bot in that application. 

To invite the bot to your server, you must head to OAuth2 -> URL Generator. Then you must select these boxs or the bot will not have the correct permissions, then copy the invite link at the bottom.

Next make sure all of these options are selected off and then copy the bot token and place it when it says 'putTokenHere'.

```
BOT_TOKEN=putTokenHere
```
 
To start the bot just run 'py main.py' and everything should be good to go! If there are any errors [contact me](#author-info) and I will do my best to help you through your error!
 
Note: Editing any of the .env vairable names will mess up the bot, DO NOT change these at anytime.
